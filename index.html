        <p>This year me and my husband took a couples trip to Europe. While in Europe we visited Paris, France, Rome, Italy and Amalfi Province of Salerno, Italy.
            While each city opened up our eyes to many unkown traditions, food, and culture. Amalfi was the only place were we actually chilled and enjoyed the beauty of the city.
            Amalfi Coast is a coastline along the southern edge of Italy. It is comprised of small towns Maiori, Minori, Amalfi, Praiano, Postiano, and Sorrento to name a few.
            Amalfi Coast has a lot of history. It is a very popular tourist attraction area during the holiday season. A func fact about Amalfi is that there are known for their
            lemon groves. Although we did not get a chance to tour the lemon goves. We were able to see how the local people strived and survived from the lemon grove. As there were
            lemon stands along the roads as we were leaving. In addition to the various lemon drinks, lemon desserts, and lemon linguine pasta dish that we tried during dinner.

        <p id="Maiori">The beautiful town of Maiori means large. And oh is Maiori large and in charge. While staying at Maiori we visited the beach. Eventhough it was high tide and our sunset
            cruise got cancled we still enjoyed the views of Maiori. We walked through town to their various shops and tried a local slice of pizza &euro; 3. Everything was just amazing. Even our 
            walk from the beach to dinner was an adventure. Oh if your ever in Maiori you must try this restaurant called Torre Normana. It litterally is a restaurant in a castle that sits right off the water. 
            The views are breathe taking as well as the food.People get around Maiori either by scotter(very popular), taxi, and or walking. One good tip would be if you stay at an AirBnB be
            mindful that Amalfi is built into the hills. With that being said pack light because lugging our luggage up and down to our place was challenging.

        <h2 class = "towns">Minori</h2>



        <p> Minori is the opposite of Maiori, whcih is small. Minori and Maiori sit right next to each other. Eventhough we stayed in Maiori our first night we went to Minori to visit. The ride over was beatiful at night the lights,
           the water, the moon, and the people were just amazing. The restaurant we went to was amazing. It was very personal. The owner was the waiter, and hostess. He took so much pride in his eatablishment and we felt like 
           he had just welcomed us into his home. So like I mentioned before Amalfi is known for their lemon groves. This incorprates into dishes as well. One of my friends was brave enough to
           try the lemon linguine dish. I tried and it was actually pretty good. We had the opportunity to have a lemon shot I belive it was called a limoncella, as compliments of the owner who had one with us. Its custom to have one after dinner because it cleanses you. We 
           defintely need a mini cleanse after all the food we ate.
